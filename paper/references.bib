                  examination is made of the impacts of academic OR on its practice. These impacts
                  include the dispersion of OR in organizations, the displacement of OR workers, and
                  the dissolution of its interdisciplinarity. Then the changes in OR's environment
                  which should have evoked adaptive responses from it, but didn't, are considered.
                  The increasing inappropriateness of OR's methodology is discussed by focusing on
                  the deficiencies of its concept and practice of optimization, and its pursuit of
                  objectivity. These deficiencies, it is argued, can only be overcome by a
                  comprehensive reconceptualization of the field, its methodology, the way it is
                  practised, and the way students are educated to practise it.},

                  for a make-to-order (MTO) production system based on the production leadtime,
                  utilisation and WIP is presented. The distribution of customer required leadtime
                  is linked to the already available equations for an M/M/1 production system from
                  queuing theory. Explicit equations for service level, FGI, FGI leadtime and
                  tardiness are presented for an M/M/1 production system within an MTO environment.
                  For a G/G/1 production system an approximation based extension is provided -
                  discussing the influence of variation in the inter-arrival and processing time
                  distribution in this framework. Moreover, the integration of a work ahead window
                  (WAW) work release policy is discussed. Based on a numerical study, a high
                  potential to decrease FGI (up to 97% FGI reduction) when applying such a WAW
                  strategy is found and it is shown that the higher the targeted service level is,
                  the higher the FGI reduction potential. The paper contributes to a better
                  understanding of the relationship between customer required leadtime distribution
                  and the M/M/1 production system. By applying this model a decision maker can base
                  his capacity investment decisions on the service level and expected tardiness for
                  certain levels of FGI and WIP and can additionally define the optimal WAW policy.},

                  reports on an experiment investigating the effects of a human facilitator and a
                  computerized Group Support System (GSS) on group meeting outcomes. These
                  treatments were applied in the same way as they are in real organizational
                  situations, with experimental conditions used to control confounding influences of
                  other outside factors. Forty-eight groups were supported by one, both, or neither
                  of the GSS and facilitator treatments. Groups designed a coordinated production
                  strategy during the meeting and then implemented their strategy. Group
                  performance, perceptions of group cohension, and group interaction processes were
                  assessed as the primary dependent variables.Facilitated groups experienced
                  improved group processes and greater cohesion, whereas the GSS-supported groups
                  did not. Facilitator and GSS support together tended to enhance one another's
                  effective influence on cohesion and processes. No significant treatment effects on
                  Performance were found. Supplemental analyses revealed that the quality of
                  facilitators and the restrictiveness of different GSS tools moderated their
                  impacts on appropriation processes and group outcomes.},

  Abstract =     {The tendency for people to perform poorly on dynamic decision-making tasks has
                  been attributed to their inability to form adequate mental models of dynamic
                  systems (Sterman, 1994). An alternative explanation is that the tabular feedback
                  formats used in previous studies do not facilitate mental representations of the
                  dynamic task and lead to processing overload. Drawing on research in the human
                  factors area, this study examined the impact of graphical versus tabular feedback
                  formats on performance, response times, and learning on a dynamic inventory
                  control task under differing levels of complexity. The graphical feedback group
                  performed better but the tabular group showed stronger evidence of learning. The
                  two groups did not differ in response times. Records of decision rationales showed
                  that participants were aware of complexity factors but were unable to cope with
                  them effectively under either feedback format. The proximity compatibility
                  principle (Wickens & Carswell, 1995) from human factors, which argues that
                  feedback must be matched to the processing requirements of the task, provides a
                  useful theoretical framework for the design and testing of feedback formats for
                  organizational tasks and criteria.},

                  behaviors. Ninety-five teams of business students (N = 412) participated in a
                  labor-scheduling simulation over a local area network. Teams were provided with
                  false negative, false positive, or neutral feedback regarding their performance.
                  Results support the hypothesis that the perception of 2 forms of organizational
                  citizenship behavior (helping behavior and civic virtue) in work groups may, in
                  part. be a function of the nature of the performance feedback that group members
                  receive. However, negative feedback appears to play a more critical role than
                  positive feedback in this attributional process. Possible reasons for these
                  findings, as well as their implications, are discussed.},

                  task interdependence manipulation and a unit-level performance manipulation and
                  provided citizenship ratings. In Study 2,148 master of business administration
                  students were exposed to a task interdependence manipulation and then rated the
                  importance of OCB in their evaluations of employee performance. In Study 3,130
                  managers rated the task interdependence in their unit of principal responsibility
                  and the importance of OCB in their overall evaluations of employee performance.
                  The results suggest task interdependence may affect the importance attributed to
                  OCB by evaluators. Implications of these results are explored. (PsycINFO Database

                  decision levels: job entry, job release and priority dispatching. In each decision
                  level, several decision points which have significant impact on the effectiveness
                  of the production planning and control are defined (i.e., acceptance/rejection,
                  due date assignment, etc.). Workload control systems should consider all of these
                  decision points simultaneously in order to improve the effectiveness of production
                  planning and control. In addition to these decision levels, flexibility of the
                  shop can also be included as the fourth decision level which allows the shop
                  capacity to be adjusted as new orders enter the system and as they are released to
                  the shop floor. In this study, simulation models which enable the effect of each
                  decision level within a workload control concept to be explored are developed and
                  tested. The results reveal that simultaneous consideration of decision levels is
                  critical and can improve the effectiveness of production planning and control.},

                  model. In the newsvendor model, a decision maker faces stochastic demand and must
                  determine the order quantity. Consistent findings in the literature are that
                  people choose order quantities that are between expected-profit-maximizing
                  quantities and mean demand and that they vary over time. We discuss how deviations
                  of people's orders from the expected-profit-maximizing quantities can be explained
                  by decision biases and alternative utility functions. We also discuss how
                  heterogeneity among people can explain between-subject variety, present
                  alternative behavioral models, and identify potential areas for future research.}

                  impact the strategies used to solve complex math problems and how consequential

                  multistep math problems under low- or high-pressure conditions and reported their
                  problem-solving strategies. Under low-pressure conditions, the higher individuals'
                  WM, the more likely they were to use computationally demanding algorithms (vs.
                  simpler shortcuts) to solve the problems, and the more accurate their math

                  the operations management (OM) field, what prior research exists, and what
                  opportunities lie ahead. The use of human experiments in operations management is
                  still fairly novel despite a small stream of publications going back more than 20
                  years. We develop a framework for identifying the types of behavioral assumptions
                  typically made in analytical OM models. We then use this framework to organize the
                  results of prior behavioral research and identify future research opportunities.

                  Johnson stressed the need to introduce behavioral factors into research models of
                  operational processes and performance. While some progress has been made since
                  then, contemporary authors argue that limited dialogue between operations
                  management and behavioral researchers continues to restrict the interpretability
                  of such studies. Drawing on expertise from both operations and behavioral
                  research, and motivated by a case example, we intend to further this dialogue. In
                  doing so, we outline interdisciplinary commonalities and several methodological
                  pitfalls that those studying the links between resource constraints and
                  operational performance should take into account when developing new research.
                  These issues range from appropriate model conceptualization to operationalization
                  for empirical studies. Recommendations for appropriately confronting
                  methodological concerns related to these issues are provided.},

  Abstract =     {Belief-elicitation experiments usually reward accuracy of stated beliefs in
                  addition to payments for other decisions. But this allows risk-averse subjects to
                  hedge with their stated beliefs against adverse outcomes of the other decisions.
                  So can we trust the existing belief-elicitation results? And can we avoid
                  potential hedging confounds? We propose an experimental design that theoretically
                  eliminates hedging opportunities. Using this design, we test for the empirical
                  relevance of hedging effects in the lab. Our results suggest that hedging
                  confounds are not a major problem unless hedging opportunities are very prominent.
                  If hedging opportunities are transparent, and incentives to hedge are strong, many
                  subjects do spot hedging opportunities and respond to them. The bias can go beyond
                  players actually hedging themselves, because some expect others to hedge and best
                  respond to this.},

                  Employees enrolled in a 3-day manufacturing resource planning training course were
                  randomly assigned to either IL or traditional training. Subjects reacted more
                  favorably to IL-based training. Trained subjects performed significantly better
                  than those in a no-treatment control group, but no differences were noted between
                  training interventions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Applied

  abstract =     { We consider a simple supply chain in which a single supplier sells to several
                  downstream retailers. The supplier has limited capacity, and retailers are
                  privately informed of their optimal stocking levels. If retailer orders exceed
                  available capacity, the supplier allocates capacity using a publicly known
                  allocation mechanism, a mapping from retailer orders to capacity assignments. We
                  show that a broad class of mechanisms are prone to manipulation: Retailers will
                  order more than they need to gain a more favorable allocation. Another class of
                  mechanisms induces the retailers to order exactly their needs, thereby revealing
                  their private information. However, there does not exist a truth-inducing
                  mechanism that maximizes total retailer profits. We also consider the supplier's
                  capacity choice. We show that a manipulable mechanism may lead the supplier to
                  choose a higher level of capacity than she would under a truth-inducing mechanism.
                  Nevertheless, her choice will appear excessively restrictive relative to the
                  prevailing distribution of orders. Furthermore, switching to a truth-inducing
                  mechanism can lower profits for the supplier, the supply chain, and even her
                  retailers. Hence, truth-telling is not a universally desirable goal. }

  abstract =     "Several studies have reported that capacitated supply chains may benefit from an
                  improved dynamic performance as compared to unconstrained ones. This occurs as a
                  consequence of the capacity limit acting as a production smoothing filter. In this
                  research, the relationship between capacity restrictions and the operational
                  performance of supply chains is investigated from a novel perspective, i.e. we
                  assume that the influence of capacity constraints on lead times depends on the
                  supply chain's responsiveness. Under these circumstances, the experiments show
                  that there is a negative effect of capacity constraints on supply chain
                  performance, both in terms of process efficiency (internal) and customer
                  satisfaction (external). Nonetheless, the magnitude of this impact greatly depends
                  on the responsiveness of the firm, market conditions and adopted policies for
                  inventory management. More specifically, the combination of tight capacity
                  restrictions and low responsiveness significantly contributes to decrease supply
                  chain performance, which may be very damaging for the dynamic behavior of the
                  system. In this sense, efficient capacity planning proves to be essential to
                  prevent the supply chain from entering into a vicious circle."

                  laboratory studies of the bullwhip effect, we find that the bullwhip effect
                  disappears in several of our experiments. More importantly, our study shows that
                  when customer demand has a predictable seasonal component, retailers smooth
                  orders. This behavior is more pronounced when changing order levels is costly. The
                  results demonstrate how simplifying the structure of the supply chain leads to

  Abstract =     {In any subject concerned with rational intervention in human affairs, theory must
                  lead to practice; but practice is the source of theory: neither theory nor
                  practice is prime. We can examine this `groundless' relation by asking what
                  intellectual framework F is applied in what methodology M to what area of
                  application A? If we do this for O.R., systems analysis, systems engineering etc.,
                  we see that F and M have changed dramatically between the 1950s and the 1980s,
                  yielding the `hard' and `soft' traditions of systems thinking. The `hard'
                  tradition, based on goal seeking, is examined in the work of Simon and contrasted
                  with the `soft' tradition, based on learning, as exemplified in the work of
                  Vickers and the development of soft systems methodology. The two are
                  complementary, but the relation between them is that the `hard' is a special case
                  of `soft' systems thinking. This analysis makes sense of the recent history of
                  management science and helps to prepare us for the 1990s.},

  Abstract =     {Overview. The aim of releasing orders is to transfer jobs from the planning stage
                  to the realization stage under consideration of economic objectives. In a job-shop
                  with order driven production, this decision problem is characterized by
                  time-related, open decision fields. In this context, a possible approach to solve
                  this problem lies in considering flexibility as a decision criterion. This
                  procedure also forms the basis of opportunistic coordination. Here, the basic idea
                  is to utilize the inherent flexibility of a production system to compensate
                  negative consequences of unexpected changes of the decision field. The aim of this
                  article is to {\dag} examine the extent in which flexibility aspects are
                  considered in relevant order release models {\dag} specify the principles of
                  opportunistic coordination within the order release planning problem to achieve a
                  flexibility-driven order release, and on this basis {\dag} develop the structure
                  of a decision model to flexibility-driven order release.},

  Abstract =     {We report three empirical studies intended to clarify why individuals misperceive
                  the relationships between stocks and flows. We tested whether familiarity with the
                  problem type, motivation to solve the problem, or the graphical presentation of
                  the problem affected participants{\textquoteright} understanding of stock and flow
                  relationships. We conclude that the misperceptions of stocks and flows are a
                  pervasive and important problem in human reasoning. Neither the domain familiarity
                  nor increased motivation helped individuals improve their perception of stock and
                  flow relationships; but it seems that the graphical representation directs
                  attention to flows and not stocks, setting the stage for subsequent mistakes.
                  Individuals attend to the most salient points of a graph rather than comprehending

  abstract =     {We examine the impact of point of sale (POS) data sharing on ordering decisions in
                  a multi-echelon supply chain. In particular, we focus on how exposure to POS data
                  may help reduce the “bullwhip effect,” the tendency of orders to increase in
                  variability as one moves up a supply chain. Theoretical studies have shown that
                  exposure to POS data can lead to a reduction in the bullwhip effect when suppliers
                  have no prior knowledge of the demand distribution. The benefit of sharing POS
                  data in stable industries, where the demand distribution is commonly known, is
                  less clear. We study this phenomenon from a behavioral perspective in the context
                  of a simple, serial, supply chain subject to information lags and stochastic
                  demand. We find, using a controlled simulation experiment, that sharing POS
                  information does help reduce some components of the bullwhip effect in a stable
                  demand setting, namely the order oscillation of upstream members. We offer one
                  possible explanation for this improvement by examining the relationship between
                  order decisions and demand line information.}

  Abstract =     {A survey of the Journal of the O.R. Society in 1978 shows that Ackoff's papers
                  were part of a quite widespread and often pessimistic debate about the practical
                  success of O.R. A similar survey for 1968 shows, on the other hand, a widespread
                  mood of optimism. It is suggested that O.R. is now in a period of crisis analogous
                  to that described by Kuhn in the Natural Sciences, when the dominant framework of
                  assumptions appears to fail in relation to important problems. When such failures
                  persist, alternative frameworks are proposed challenging the hitherto accepted
                  view, and an increasingly wide-ranging debate develops. Many of the features of
                  such debates, as outlined by Kuhn, seem to be present in the current controversy
                  within O.R. More specifically, it seems possible in O.R. and related fields to
                  identify three rival sets of proposals, which may be labelled official, reformist
                  (e.g. Ackoffian) and revolutionary. However, the debate in O.R. differs from that
                  in the Natural Sciences because it is not just about the best means of
                  understanding the empirical world. It is also about the type of social world to be
                  constructed through the framework of assumptions adopted. Our view is that in the
                  current debate, proponents of the reformist stance will probably win. However,
                  this may be very much an interim solution.},

                  systematic dysfunctional behavior in the presence of dynamic complexity - settings
                  with multiple feedback loops, time delays, and nonlinearities. However, prior work
                  has not adequately mapped the effect of these elements of complexity on
                  performance. We report an experiment where subjects managed an inventory in the
                  face of stochastic sales, a classic dynamic decision task. We vary the time delays
                  and strength of the feedback loops to explore the impact of these elements of
                  dynamic complexity on behavior. Subjects faced financial incentives and had
                  opportunities to learn. Yet performance was significantly worse than optimal
                  across all conditions. Subjects outperformed a naive "do-nothing" rule in the
                  simple conditions, but performance deteriorated dramatically with increasing time
                  delays and feedback effects, and most were outperformed by the do-nothing rule in
                  the complex conditions. Regression analysis of subjects$\prime$ decisions showed
                  most ignored the supply line of pending production and undercontrolled the system.
                  Undercontrol increased significantly with growing time delays and feedback
                  strength, showing subjects were insufficiently adaptive despite perfect knowledge
                  of system structure and parameters. Subjects$\prime$ understanding of complex
                  feedback settings declines as delays between cause and effect increase and as

  Abstract =     {In this paper, we consider the design of a synchronous, unpaced flow line where
                  workers operate at different skill levels and overtime is used, if necessary, to
                  meet a daily production quota. The line is unpaced in the sense that items only
                  move to the next workstation when all workers on the line have completed their
                  respective tasks. The design problem in this case is to assign both workers and
                  tasks to workstations to minimize the expected sum of regular and overtime costs.
                  To solve this problem, we develop an optimization algorithm for smaller problems
                  and a heuristic algorithm for larger problems, which we use to investigate the
                  sensitivity of total expected cost to changes in the price of overtime, hiring
                  practices, worker differences, and the overall amount of work time variability.
                  Based on an extensive computational analysis, we found that (1) planned overtime
                  is frequently beneficial, (2) more workers should be hired as worker variability
                  increases, and (3) increases in overtime costs frequently yield a relatively lower
                  percentage increase in total expected cost. Other managerial implications are
                  discussed in the paper.},

                  underscore the importance of the research efforts, current practice is described
                  and its shortcomings are exposed. Mathematical programming models where the
                  planning horizon is subdivided into several discrete periods are given for both
                  approaches that are well-established and approaches which may represent tomorrow's

                  time models and multi-level lot sizing and scheduling. The paper concludes with
                  some advice for future research activities. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

                  order sequencing/dispatching level. The objective is to manage the delivery dates

                  appropriate decision making techniques at each level. At the first level, the main

                  some relevant limitations (e. g. capacity constraint). At this level, an extended

                  International Journal of Production Economics, 111, 351-367.) is applied. Besides
                  rejecting some of the low priority orders, determination of delivery dates and
                  prices for the non-rejected orders constitute the other outputs of this level. The
                  second level is related to releasing the accepted orders to the shop floor. The
                  decision making problems at this level include which orders and when they can be
                  released. We develop a new order release method which improves the delivery date
                  performance through generating a smoothed production schedule. Finally, at the
                  third level, a modified dispatching rule is proposed to sequence the existing
                  orders at each workstation so that the previously agreed delivery dates can be
                  met. The proposed models at the second and third levels are validated through a
                  number of numerical experiments conducted by simulation studies and the
                  corresponding results are discussed in details.},

  Abstract =     {We consider the problem of setting safety stock when both the demand in a period
                  and the lead time are random variables. There are two cases to consider. In the
                  first case the parameters of the demand and lead time distributions are known; in
                  the second case they are unknown and must be estimated. For the case of known
                  parameters a standard procedure is presented in the literature. In this paper,
                  examples are used to show that this procedure can yield results that are far from
                  the desired result. A correct procedure is presented.When the parameters are
                  unknown, it is assumed that a simple exponential smoothing model is used to
                  generate estimates of demand in each period and that a discrete distribution of
                  the lead time can be developed from historical data. A correct procedure for
                  setting safety stocks that is based on these two inputs is given for two popular
                  demand models. The approach is easily generalized to other models of demand.
                  Safety stock calculation is simplified when certain normality assumptions are
                  valid. Simulation results in the Appendix indicate when these assumptions about
                  normality are reasonable.},

  Abstract =     {Over the last decades, there has been a steady increase in the use of experimental
                  methods in economics. We discuss the advantages of experiments for labour
                  economics in this paper. Control is the most important asset behind running
                  experiments; no other empirical method allows a similarly tight control as do
                  experiments. Moreover, experiments produce replicable evidence and permit the
                  implementation of truly exogenous ceteris paribus changes. We also discuss
                  frequent objections to experiments, such as a potential subject pool bias, the
                  stake levels used in experiments, the number of observations as well as internal
                  and external validity. We argue that although these objections are important,
                  careful experimentation can circumvent them. While we think that lab and field
                  experiments offer a very valuable tool, they should not be viewed as substitutes
                  but as complements to more traditional methods of empirical economic analysis.},

  Abstract =     {This paper presents an Integrated approach for Material Planning and finite
                  Operations Scheduling (IMPOS). The approach assumes the existence of a system that
                  provides a relative priority measure for customer orders, based on a predetermined
                  set of factors including-but not limited to-due dates. Orders are sequenced on
                  descending order of the priority measures to form the Master Production Sequence
                  (MPS) list. Starting from the top of the MPS list, orders are planned one at a
                  time, by determining their respective quantity requirements first. The next phase
                  schedules the requirements by time allocation of the available finite resources to
                  their operational requirements. The IMPOS approach attempts to reduce production
                  lead times during its finite scheduling procedure through analysis of the details
                  of each operation in conjunction with other associated operations and the ordering
                  policy applied. Generating finite schedules quickly enables IMPOS to handle
                  effectively the dynamic behaviour of the manufacturing environment. The approach
                  is detailed and exemplified.},

                  savings, dependent on the level of workload in the shop, for two alternative
                  strategies, namely considering set-up times centrally, within the release decision
                  or locally, within the dispatching decision. These strategies are compared and
                  assessed on the basis of two main performance measures namely time in system and
                  standard deviation of the job lateness. Results indicate that the local strategy,
                  which has been traditionally adopted in practice and in most of the studies
                  dealing with sequence-dependent set-up times, does not always give the best
                  results. The release frequency and the shop workload appear critical to the

                  multiple loops and both positive and negative feedback, are found the modes of

                  (HOPS). The HOPS network was established in 2004 and was funded as a so-called
                  {\textquotedblleft}Action{\textquotedblright} by COST (European Cooperation in
                  Science and Technology; cf. http://www.cost.eu) for a period of four years. COST
                  supports new Actions when they address a relatively new and relevant ?eld of
                  research, in many cases interdisciplinary. COST Actions have an open nature and
                  any researcher interested in the topic can join them. The HOPS network has been
                  important in the sense that researchers with a wide variety of disciplines have
                  been working together on joint projects over the course of the Action. The joint
                  research has been very productive, with dozens of joint papers having been
                  published in academic journals over the past few years. In this book, we have
                  brought together the main results from the Action, but have furthermore
                  complemented these by providing more extensive, expository back- ground writing in
                  each of the Chapters that will enable the novel and experienced researcher in this
                  ?eld to get quickly at grip with the various disciplinary insights and knowledge
                  that underlie our studies. We therefore expect this book to be useful for a
                  variety of audiences. First of all, it serves as a reference of the current state
                  of research in the ?eld for those interested in conducting research in this area
                  and intending to broaden their disciplinary and methodological scope. Second, it
                  can serve as teaching material in a graduate course on the role that humans play
                  in planning and scheduling environments. Finally, it also serves to help
                  practitioner to better understand the background of their experiences with
                  planning and scheduling systems, and provides guidelines and insights in how to
                  better manage the design and implementation of such systems. We would like to
                  thank COST, especially Alfredas Chmieliauskas (COST Rapporteur), David Gronbaek,
                  Julia Stamm, Francesca Boscolo (Scienti?c Of?- cers), and Jie Zhu (Administrative
                  Of?cer) for their support to the Action, without which this network never would
                  have been established. Especially the low bureau- cratic burden by which ?nancial
                  support is provided by COST strongly stimulates new networks like ours. Second, we
                  would like to thank all contributors to this volume in spending their time to
                  consolidate their multitude of ?ndings and insights into a set of extensive and
                  comprehensive book chapters. Finally, we would like to thank Eindhoven University
                  of Technology, and especially Walter Stein, for supporting us in the ?nal editing
                  stages of the process. Many book projects tend to fail at this important stage and
                  without the support of Walter this book would not have been realized. Eindhoven,

                  theory, and organization theory. Simon{\textquoteright}s work was motivated by the
                  belief that neither the human mind, human thinking and decision making, nor human
                  creativity need be mysterious. It was after he helped create
                  {\textquotedblleft}thinking{\textquotedblright} machines that Simon came to
                  understand human intuition as subconscious pattern recognition. In doing so he
                  showed that intuition need not be associated with magic and mysticism, and that it
                  is complementary with analytical thinking. This paper will show how the overlaps
                  in his work and especially his work on AI affected his view towards intuition.},

                  model how three workload control rule components - order selection, work
                  aggregation and buffer limits - affect shop performance in environments that
                  differ in their bottleneck utilization and protective capacity levels. Two of the
                  most frequently studied rules in the literature - CONWIP and DBR - were included
                  in the simulation. Data analysis found that the workload control rules had a
                  significant positive effect on the shop performance measures only in environments
                  with the highest bottleneck utilization and the lowest protective capacity.
                  However, the work aggregation method was found to be an important component of the
                  workload control rule. Suggestions were made for future research that could
                  increase our understanding of workload control rules and integrate this research

                  treatment effect, even in randomized experiments, if needed covariates are
                  omitted. The asymptotic bias is determined both for estimates based on the method
                  of moments and for maximum likelihood estimates. The asymptotic bias from omitting
                  covariates is shown to be zero if the regression of the response variable on
                  treatment and covariates is linear or exponential, and, in regular cases, this is
                  a necessary condition for zero bias. Many commonly used models do have such
                  exponential regressions; thus randomization ensures unbiased treatment estimates
                  in a large number of important nonlinear models. For moderately censored
                  exponential survival data, analysis with the exponential survival model yields
                  less biased estimates of treatment effect than analysis with the proportional
                  hazards model of Cox, if needed covariates are omitted. Simulations confirm that
                  calculations of asymptotic bias are in excellent agreement with the bias observed
                  in experiments of modest size.},

  Abstract =     {What counts as human rationality: reasoning processes that embody
                  content-independent formal theories, such as propositional logic, or reasoning
                  processes that are well designed for solving important adaptive problems? Most
                  theories of human reasoning have been based on content-independent formal
                  rationality, whereas adaptive reasoning, ecological or evolutionary, has been
                  little explored. We elaborate and test an evolutionary approach, Cosmides' (1989)
                  social contract theory, using the Wason selection task. In the first part, we
                  disentangle the theoretical concept of a {\textquotedblleft}social
                  contract{\textquotedblright} from that of a {\textquotedblleft}cheater-detection
                  algorithm{\textquotedblright}. We demonstrate that the fact that a rule is
                  perceived as a social contract --- or a conditional permission or obligation, as
                  Cheng and Holyoak (1985) proposed --- is not sufficient to elicit Cosmides'
                  striking results, which we replicated. The crucial issue is not semantic (the
                  meaning of the rule), but pragmatic: whether a person is cued into the perspective
                  of a party who can be cheated. In the second part, we distinguish between social
                  contracts with bilateral and unilateral cheating options. Perspective change in
                  contracts with bilateral cheating options turns P & not-Q responses into not-P & Q
                  responses. The results strongly support social contract theory, contradict
                  availability theory, and cannot be accounted for by pragmatic reasoning schema
                  theory, which lacks the pragmatic concepts of perspectives and cheating
                  detection.},

  Abstract =     {By definition, dynamic decision making dictates that multiple and interrelated
                  decisions be made in a continuously changing environment. Such decision making is
                  difficult and often taxes individuals{\textquoteright} cognitive resources. Here I
                  investigated ways in which to support decision making in these environments. I
                  evaluated three forms of decision support: outcome feedback, cognitive feedback,
                  and feedforward that incorporated (to varying degrees) common features of learning
                  theories associated with dynamic tasks. Participants in a laboratory experiment
                  performed a real-time, dynamic decision-making task while receiving one of the
                  different types of decision support. During the first 2 days, individuals received
                  one type of decision support, but on the third day they performed the task without
                  this support. Participants who received feedforward improved their performance
                  considerably and continued to exhibit improved performance even after
                  discontinuation of the decision support on the third day. Neither outcome feedback
                  nor cognitive feedback resulted in improved performance. More research is
                  necessary to conclusively identify the best forms of dynamic decision-making
                  support and their durability when transferred to new tasks.},

  Abstract =     {For the operational planning and production control domain criteria and measures
                  are suggested according to which the successfulness of operational planning and
                  production control can be evaluated and that process assessed in relation to
                  others and a certain reference system by virtue of an adequate coefficient. Three
                  criteria and measures for evaluating operational planning and production control
                  are given and analysed, as well as a synthetic criterion for a consolidated
                  evaluation. The example from the undertaken research in one production system
                  shows the evaluation of operational planning and production control, and by means
                  of an adequate model, an estimate is made of the possibility for the improvement
                  of that process by using the available resources, without making any investments.},

  Abstract =     {We point out the need for Behavioral Operational Research (BOR) in advancing the
                  practice of OR. So far, in OR behavioral phenomena have been acknowledged only in
                  behavioral decision theory but behavioral issues are always present when
                  supporting human problem solving by modeling. Behavioral effects can relate to the
                  group interaction and communication when facilitating with OR models as well as to
                  the possibility of procedural mistakes and cognitive biases. As an illustrative
                  example we use well known system dynamics studies related to the understanding of
                  accumulation. We show that one gets completely opposite results depending on the
                  way the phenomenon is described and how the questions are phrased and graphs used.
                  The results suggest that OR processes are highly sensitive to various behavioral
                  effects. As a result, we need to pay attention to the way we communicate about
                  models as they are being increasingly used in addressing important problems like
                  climate change.},

  Abstract =     {We consider the problem of planning future order releases in hierarchical
                  production planning and control systems. An established research direction is the
                  clearing function concept: The planned material flow through a production unit is
                  modeled by inventory balance equations for WIP and final products, and the
                  consequences of the stochastic properties of the material flow are modeled by
                  clearing functions, which represent the functional relationship between the level
                  of WIP and the maximum output of a work centre in a period. Theoretical insights
                  suggest that modeling the output of a work centre in a period as a function of one
                  independent variable is not sufficient for this type of models because of the
                  time-varying transient states. This paper tests one- and two-dimensional clearing
                  functions on simulation and empirical data obtained from a make-to-order
                  production system. The fit of the clearing functions will be made by a regression
                  through the origin and evaluated by the adjusted R2. The fits of the different
                  clearing functions differ depending on the source of data. The possibilities for
                  improvements by adding independent variables depend both on the period length and
                  on the stationarity of the process. The findings lead to suggestions which
                  additional independent variables should be added to a clearing function in order
                  to improve the estimation of a work centre's future output and hence improve order
                  release planning models.},

  Abstract =     {The world of manufacturing has recently undergone many major changes leading to
                  guidelines on what is "best practice" or world class manufacturing (WCM) in terms
                  of both methods of operation and of performance. These guidelines are based on the
                  companies that have been most successful, mainly the mass production industry,
                  that has been transformed into the mass customisation sector. This paper argues
                  that such guidelines cannot be entirely appropriate to other industry sectors, in
                  particular to the traditional "make-to-order" (MTO) sector. The highly variable
                  customer demand in this sector often means that it is strategically desirable to
                  retain a job shop layout for at least part of the business, rather than converting
                  the business to a series of focused cells. This paper seeks to propose a set of
                  alternative guidelines on how MTO companies that choose to retain a job shop
                  layout should attempt to attain WCM status. To justify the proposals, it presents
                  some case study evidence giving two examples of companies that have remained job
                  shops and explaining how one of them has nonetheless made substantial improvements
                  in performance and practice.},

  Abstract =     {Workload control (WLC) is a method of production planning and control, which when
                  commenced at the customer enquiry stage, has particular relevance to producers of
                  highly customised products. Although previous research has suggested that WLC has
                  great potential to improve performance, only a few successful case studies have
                  been reported. To facilitate more widespread use of WLC, this paper seeks to
                  investigate issues that arise from implementing WLC systems through a rare
                  comparative case study analysis. Two companies are studied, a capital goods
                  manufacturer and a precision engineering sub-contractor. The study initially
                  identifies emerging research questions that address 17 implementation issues,
                  including those related to the market/customer, the primary manufacturing process,
                  the WLC system requirements, the flow of information and embedding WLC within the
                  organisation. For each implementation issue, an appropriate response is given that
                  leads to changes in the theory underpinning WLC or the development of WLC
                  implementation strategy. Finally, areas in need of further research are suggested,
                  providing direction for fellow scholars in the field of WLC. These areas include
                  the further refinement of the implementation requirements for WLC in additional
                  case study settings and the need for simulation studies to verify the
                  effectiveness of some of the proposed changes to the underlying theory of WLC. (C)

  Abstract =     {This target article is concerned vith the implications of the surprisingly
                  different experimental practices in economics and in areas of psychology relevant
                  to both economists and psychologists, such as behavioral decision making. We
                  consider four features of experimentation in economics, namely, script enactment,
                  repeated trials, performance-based monetary payments, and the proscription against
                  deception, and compare them to experimental practices in psychology, primarily in
                  the area of behavioral decision making. Whereas economists bring a precisely
                  defined "script" to experiments for participants to enact, psychologists often do
                  not provide such a script, leaving Participants to infer what choices the
                  situation affords. By often using repeated experimental trials, economists allow
                  participants to learn about the tusk and the environment; psychologists typically
                  do not. Economists generally pay participants on the basis of clearly defined
                  performance criteria; psychologists usually pay a flat fee or grant a fixed amount
                  of course credit. Economists virtually never deceive participants; psychologists,
                  especially in some areas of inquiry, often do. We argue that experimental
                  standards in economics are regulatory in that they allow for little variation
                  between the experimental practices of individual researchers. The experimental
                  standards in psychology, by contrast, are comparatively laissez-faire. We believe
                  that the wider range of experimental practices in psychology reflects a lack of
                  procedural regularity that may contribute to the variability of empirical findings
                  in the research fields under consideration. We conclude vith a call for more
                  research on the consequences of methodological preferences, such as the use on
                  monetary payments, and propose a "do-it-both-ways" rule regarding the enactment of
                  scripts, repetition of trials, and performance-based monetary payments. We also
                  argue, on pragmatic grounds, that the default practice should be not to deceive
                  participants.},

  Abstract =     {Most research on cellular manufacturing (CM) has focused on the technical issues
                  involved in converting functionally segregated operations into integrated
                  multifunctional cells. Examples of these technical issues include classification
                  methods, physical arrangements, methods for reducing set-up time, and design of
                  work flow sequence. By comparison, research on the human or social side of CM has
                  been notably lacking. With the exception of anecdotal descriptions of CM concerns
                  (Fazakerley (1974, 1976)), only two empirical studies have attempted to
                  systematically pinpoint the nature of human resource issues in these settings
                  (Brown and Mitchell (1991); Huber and Hyer (1985)). Consequently, the social
                  system factors that support CM success are not well understood. Based on
                  sociotechnical systems (STS) theories, it is suggested that a complementary match
                  between technical and social systems is needed to ensure optimization of CM
                  implementations. One avenue for effecting social system change in response to
                  technical innovations is through an organization's human resource system.
                  Planning, job analysis, selection, training, reward structures, and employee
                  relations practices may make a difference in the relative success of a CM
                  conversion, and also may influence employee attitudes and quality of work life.
                  These human resource practices provide support for attaining Cherns' (1978) nine
                  STS principles---compatibility, minimal critical specification, the sociotechnical
                  criterion, information flow, multifunctioning, boundary location, support
                  congruence, human values, and incompletion. The integration of human resource
                  management practices and STS theories provides implementation guidelines and also
                  helps to reveal areas where research is needed. Longitudinal and cross-sectional
                  field studies will be the methodologies of choice for assessing human resource
                  issues in CM settings. For example, descriptive studies may assess job
                  satisfaction, pay satisfaction, job content, or perceptions of performance
                  obstacles. Of equal importance will be research which tests the effectiveness of
                  various human resource practices (e.g., realistic job previews, training. team
                  incentive systems) in CM settings. Dependent variables for these studies may
                  include economic measures such as throughput time, quality, inventory levels, and
                  employee turnover rates, as well as measures of employee attitudes and the time
                  required for full CM implementation. Field research will improve our understanding
                  of the human resource practices which are most likely to enhance CM
                  implementations, and also will further our understanding of STS relationships.},

                  this problem type, we focus on a critical stock policy with a linear order release
                  rule. A central parameter of this type of policy is given by the safety stock
                  value. When non-zero manufacturing lead times are taken into account in the random
                  yield context, it turns out that safety stocks have to be determined that vary
                  from period to period. We present a simple approach for calculating these dynamic
                  safety stocks for different yield models. Additionally, we suggest approaches for

                  individual differences for performance at capacity limits? We used functional
                  magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the impact of increases in
                  processing demand on selected cortical areas when participants performed a
                  parametrically varied and challenging dual task. Low-performing participants
                  respond with large and load-dependent activation increases in many cortical areas
                  when exposed to excessive task requirements, accompanied by decreasing
                  performance. It seems that these participants recruit additional attentional and
                  strategy-related resources with increasing difficulty, which are either not
                  relevant or even detrimental to performance. In contrast, the brains of the
                  high-performing participants "keep cool" in terms of activation changes, despite
                  continuous correct performance, reflecting different and more efficient

                  performance on activation patterns and underline the importance of the

                  motives on the relationship between a ratee's reputation and helpful behaviors and
                  raters' reward decisions. During managerial simulations, raters evaluated
                  individuals after watching videotapes in which the individual's reputation and
                  helpful behaviors were manipulated. Results indicated an interaction effect
                  between reputation and helpful behaviors such that a helpful person with a good
                  reputation received more rewards than did a helpful person with a bad reputation.
                  In contrast, an unhelpful person with a good reputation did not receive better
                  rewards than an unhelpful person with a bad reputation. Moreover, raters' liking
                  of ratees and the motives raters attributed to ratees' helpful behaviors mediated
                  the relationship between the manipulations and raters' reward decisions. [ABSTRACT

  Abstract =     {This paper presents an approach to modeling workers where human performance has a
                  significant impact on system productivity. Highly technical industries such as
                  semiconductor manufacturing and service industries like banking are relying on
                  fewer but more skilled workers. In these systems, productivity depends on worker
                  availability and organization; therefore, modeling system performance may require
                  accurate representations of individual worker behavior. This paper examines the
                  tradeoffs in including information about the demographics and personalities of
                  workers in system performance simulation models. A series of actual and simulated
                  experiments in which personality and demographic data are used in different ways
                  to model the performance of a team of workers is reported. Significant differences
                  are found in predicted system performance demonstrating that model validity
                  depends on the methodology used for modeling workers. These results have practical
                  implication for the managerial processes of recruiting and selecting individual
                  workers, as well as organizing teams of workers and assigning them to tasks.},

  Abstract =     {This paper explores a heuristic---representativeness---according to which the
                  subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to
                  which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population;
                  and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated.
                  This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating
                  predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In
                  particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population,
                  it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This
                  prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions
                  and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient
                  characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size
                  of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative
                  (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty.},

  Abstract =     {This paper extends the ideas put forward in an earlier EJOR article to develop a
                  methodology for controlling manufacturing lead times. Past approaches have
                  concentrated on scheduling a given set of orders through the shop floor in some
                  optimal fashion to meet their specified delivery dates. This is clearly
                  sub-optimal since it covers only part of the total lead time. It is shown that a
                  higher level approach is more appropriate in which the order book is deliberately
                  moulded into a shape that can be produced profitably. This should be achieved at
                  the customer enquiry stage, when the prices and delivery dates to quote are
                  determined. Hence a structural approach has been adopted which includes customer
                  orders planning and job release functions. The basic concepts developed include a
                  hierarchy of backlogs of work responsible for a consequent hierarchy of lead times
                  that add up to the total delivery lead time. Input/output control procedures aim
                  at maintaining the backlogs, and hence lead times, within norms set by
                  management.},

  Abstract =     {Workload control (WLC) systems can be seen as a natural extension of input-output
                  control systems which allow both the control of jobs into the shop and the control
                  of capacity which affects the flow of finished goods out of the shop. In previous
                  research, it has been shown that WLC can help to reduce manufacturing lead times,
                  even if the total workload processed by the shop in a given time period is
                  maintained at a constant rate. However, the relative contributions of the input
                  control mechanisms versus the output control mechanisms have not been clearly
                  determined. This paper seeks to explore this issue using a simulation of a real
                  job shop, in which the WLC system that has been developed at Lancaster University
                  is used. It explores the use of input control alone and the use of input control
                  plus output control. In addition, the relation between workload and various
                  performance measures, such as lead time, queueing time and capacity utilisation,
                  is explored. The results of the experiments show that one should consider input
                  control and output control as two levers of control that are both to be pulled
                  rather than relying on the single lever of stopping the input when the WIP reaches
                  some preset level.},

  Abstract =     {Research on cognitive processes in decision making has identified heuristics that
                  often work well but sometimes lead to serious errors. This paper presents an
                  investigation of the performance of heuristics in a complex dynamic setting,
                  characterized by repeated decisions with feedback. There are three components: (1)
                  A simulated task resembling medical decision problems (diagnosis and treatment) is
                  described. (2) Computer models of decision strategies are developed. These include
                  models based on cognitive heuristics as well as benchmark strategies that indicate
                  the limit of the heuristic strategies' performance. The upper benchmark is based
                  on statistical decision theory, the lower one on random trial and error. (3)
                  Selected task characteristics are systematically varied and their influence on
                  performance evaluated in simulation experiments. Results indicate that task
                  characteristics often studied in past research (e.g., symptom diagonosticity,
                  disease base-rates) have less influence on performance relative to
                  feedback-related aspects of the task. These dynamic characteristics are a major
                  determinant of when heuristics perform well or badly. The results also provide
                  insights about the costs and benefits of various cognitive heuristics. In
                  addition, the possible contribution of this research to the design and evaluation
                  of decision aids is considered.},

                  information display lead to changes in the anticipated effort and anticipated
                  accuracy of each available strategy and, therefore, provide an incentive for
                  decision makers to use different decision processes. Research in this area can

                  control (WLC) for job shop practices. WLC principles have been integrated into a
                  comprehensive concept, which receives a lot of attention in scientific literature
                  in recent years. Though meant as a robust concept for dynamic environments, the
                  WLC concept needs a large number of parameters to be specified. The key decision
                  of order release requires the specification of workload norms, planned throughput
                  times, a release frequency, and a time limit. Past studies have shown the delicacy
                  of parameter setting. Still, research providing sound theoretical foundations is
                  limited. This paper aims at improving the basis for setting parameters, showing
                  the impact of parameters on performance and analysing sensitivity. It provides an
                  in-depth analysis of the mechanisms within WLC that affect the relevant
                  performance dimensions. It exposes the critical elements, which result in a
                  fragile balance between control of average throughput times and variance of due
                  date deviations. The influence of each parameter on this balance is assessed in a
                  simulation study. The results provide a number of new insights. Due date
                  performance appears to depend on only one of the intended pillars within WLC. The
                  intended due date orientation of the order release sequence hardly contributes to
                  performance, but is partly compensated by the control of shop floor throughput
                  times. Paradoxically, the influence of the planned throughput time values and
                  workload norms is shown to be limited, while the choice of the workload
                  calculation method, release frequency and time limit appears critical. Either
                  throughput time performance or due date performance is highly sensitive to each
                  parameter. The results have important consequences for implementations of WLC
                  concepts in practice and give rise to a change of focus in parameter setting.},

  Abstract =     {This study aims to provide a profound picture of where existing production
                  planning and control (PPC) concepts fail in small to medium sized make-to-order
                  (MTO) companies. While several studies have discussed the specific requirements of
                  small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) through surveys or observations in order
                  to determine the suitability of existing PPC concepts, in general, in-depth
                  empirical evidence is rare. In this article, seven case study companies are
                  studied with the backbone of the analysis based on order progress data collected
                  from each company. In each case, logistic performance problems are determined and
                  traced back to their root causes. To distinguish between common problems and
                  company specific elements, a comparative analysis across the cases has been
                  performed. The analysis shows that a significant proportion of common PPC problems
                  can be attributed to a limited set of decision points in the flow of orders.
                  Furthermore, we find that most performance losses can actually be predicted before
                  an order is released to the shop floor. Decisions after release are mainly made in
                  order to correct for the delays caused before release. In the pre-production
                  phase, before release, two common problem areas are identified: (1) inadequate
                  capacity planning overviews to support sales decisions, and (2) uncontrolled
                  delays in engineering. Observed problems that appear after release tend to be more
                  diverse and company-specific. A review of available PPC concepts for MTO SMEs
                  indicates that these areas have been neglected in the literature to date, leading
                  to our call for a new focus in PPC research.},

                  with forecasts from deseasonalised single exponential smoothing. Combined
                  forecasts are found to be more accurate than single forecasts with the greatest
                  benefit realised at short forecast horizons and for easier (as opposed to harder)
                  forecast series. Averaging was observed to be a far better way of combining
                  judgemental forecasts than a judgemental, nonsystematic combination.},

  Abstract =     {The literature on JIT production suggests a causal link between work-in-process
                  inventory and manufacturing productivity. Such a connection has been described in
                  numerous case studies but never tested statistically. This paper uses historical
                  data for 52 Japanese automotive companies to evaluate the inventory-productivity
                  relationship. We find that firms increased their productivity rank during periods
                  of substantial inventory reduction. More detailed tests suggest that inventory
                  reductions stimulated gains in productivity: On average, each 10% reduction in
                  inventory led to about a 1% gain in labor productivity, with a lag of about one
                  year. Such effects were more immediate for Toyota affiliates, but undetectable for
                  close suppliers of Nissan. These findings imply that inventory reduction served as
                  an important driver of process improvement for many Japanese automotive companies,
                  although some firms emphasized other methods.},

  abstract =     {This paper presents a detailed study of average reward reinforcement learning, an
                  undiscounted optimality framework that is more appropriate for cyclical tasks than
                  the much better studied discounted framework. A wide spectrum of average reward
                  algorithms are described, ranging from synchronous dynamic programming methods to
                  several (provably convergent) asynchronous algorithms from optimal control and
                  learning automata. A general sensitive discount optimality metric called
                  n-discount-optimality is introduced, and used to compare the various algorithms.
                  The overview identifies a key similarity across several asynchronous algorithms
                  that is crucial to their convergence, namely independent estimation of the average
                  reward and the relative values. The overview also uncovers a surprising limitation
                  shared by the different algorithms: while several algorithms can provably generate
                  gain-optimal policies that maximize average reward, none of them can reliably
                  filter these to produce bias-optimal (or T-optimal) policies that also maximize
                  the finite reward to absorbing goal states. This paper also presents a detailed
                  empirical study of R-learning, an average reward reinforcement learning method,
                  using two empirical testbeds: a stochastic grid world domain and a simulated robot
                  environment A detailed sensitivity analysis of R-learning is carried out to test
                  its dependence on learning rates and exploration levels. The results suggest that
                  R-learning is quite sensitive to exploration strategies, and can fall into
                  sub-optimal limit cycles. The performance of R-learning is also compared with that
                  of Q-learning, the best studied discounted RL method. Here, the results suggest
                  that R-learning can be fine-tuned to give better performance than Q-learning in
                  both domains.},

  Abstract =     {Due to the heritage and history of operations management, its research
                  methodologies have been confined mainly to that of quantitative modeling and, on
                  occasion, statistical analysis. The field has been changing dramatically in recent
                  years. Firms now face numerous worldwide competitive challenges, many of which
                  require major improvements in the operations function. Yet, the research
                  methodologies in operations have largely remained stagnant. The paradigm on which
                  these methodologies are based, while useful, limits the kinds of questions
                  researchers can address. This paper presents a review and critique of the research
                  in operations, itemizing the shortcomings identified by researchers in the field.
                  These researchers suggest a new research agenda with an integrative view of
                  operations' role in organizations, a wider application of alternative research
                  methodologies, greater emphasis on benefit to the operations manager,
                  cross-disciplinary research with other functional areas, a heavier emphasis on
                  sociotechnical analysis over the entire production system, and empirical field
                  studies. Some of the alternative research methodologies mentioned include
                  longitudinal studies, field experiments, action research, and field studies.
                  Following a description of the nature of research, three stages in the research
                  cycle are identified: description, explanation, and testing. Although research can
                  deal with any stage in this cycle, the majority of attention currently seems to
                  focus on the explanation stage. The paper then discusses historical trends in the
                  philosophy of science, starting with positivism, expanding into empiricism, and
                  then leading to post-positivism. The impacts of each of these trends on research
                  in operations (which remains largely in the positivist mode) are described.
                  Discussion of the importance of a plurality of research methods concludes the
                  section. A framework for research paradigms is then developed based on two key
                  dimensions of research methodologies: the rational versus existential structure of
                  the research process and the natural versus artificial basis for the information
                  used in the research. These dimensions are then further explored in terms of
                  thirteen characteristic measures. Next, research methodologies commonly used in
                  other fields as well as operations are described in reference to this framework.
                  Methodologies include those traditional to operations such as normative and
                  descriptive modeling, simulation, surveys, case and field studies as well as those
                  more common to other fields such as action research, historical analysis, expert
                  panels, scenarios, interviewing, introspection, and hermeneutics. Examples from
                  operations or allied fields are given to illustrate the methodologies. Past
                  research publications in operations are plotted on the framework to see the
                  limitations of our current paradigms relative to the richness of other fields. We
                  find that operations methodologies tend to lie on the more rational end of the
                  framework while spanning the natural/artificial dimension, though the majority of
                  research is at the artificial pole. Last, recommendations are made for applying
                  the framework and paradigms to research issues in operations management. The
                  topics of quality management and technology implementation are used as examples to
                  illustrate how a wide variety of methodologies might be employed to research a
                  much broader range of issues than has currently been researched.},

  Abstract =     {Some observers have expressed concern over the state of the OR/MS profession,
                  especially as to its failure to tackle complex, messy problems. One response has
                  been to develop various ``soft'' methods (also called ``problem structuring
                  methods'') that focus on the human and political aspects of OR/MS interventions.
                  Recent work, both theoretical and practitioner-based, involves the combination of
                  several methods in a particular project (multimethod). Often the combination
                  includes both hard (quantitative) and soft (qualitative) approaches. This paper
                  illustrates the utility of soft methods, and in particular their combination, with
                  recently published case studies. It then proposes an approach to the process of
                  combining methods, including several frameworks and techniques to assist in

  Abstract =     {The systems approach, or systems thinking, has been intimately connected with the
                  development of OR and management science initially through the work of founders
                  such as Churchman and Ackoff and latterly through innovations such as soft
                  systems. In this paper we have undertaken a review of the contribution that
                  systems thinking has been making more recently, especially to the practice of OR.
                  Systems thinking is a discipline in its own right, with many theoretical and
                  methodological developments, but it is also applicable to almost any problem area
                  because of its generality, and so such a review must always be selective. We have
                  looked at the literature from both a theoretical and an applications orientation.
                  In the first part we consider the main systems theories and methodologies in terms
                  of their recent developments and also their applications. This covers: the systems
                  approach, complexity theory, cybernetics, system dynamics, soft OR and PSMs,
                  critical systems and multimethodology. In the second part we review the main
                  domains of application: strategy, information systems, organisations, production

  Abstract =     {Sequence-dependent setup times lead to a potential for savings in setups if an
                  appropriate sequencing rule is used at the detailed scheduling level. The benefits
                  of savings in setups have to be taken into account by the higher planning levels
                  of a production planning and control system. If we assume a complex production
                  planning situation (complex products, multi-stage production, job-shop
                  production), a workload control concept is often a good way to keep flow times and
                  capacity utilization under control. In such a planning concept, order release has
                  the task to keep work-in-process (WIP) at an appropriate level. In the case of
                  sequence-dependent setup times, the total amount of setup time (for given lot
                  sizes) depends on the level of WIP in the shop, and this relationship must be
                  known to the order release function to determine the appropriate level of WIP in
                  the shop. In this paper, the functional relationship between WIP and total setup
                  time is examined. An approximate queueing model is developed to show the function
                  for a certain setup-saving sequencing rule, and the results of the model are
                  compared to simulation results.},

  Abstract =     {An important basis for workload control (WLC) is the existence of functional
                  relationships between the mean level of work-in-process (WIP) and the values of
                  important goal variables, like average flow time, capacity utilization, etc. These
                  functional relationships are largely influenced by the lot sizes. This means that
                  the usual objective of lot sizing must be supplemented by considering the impact
                  of lot sizes on the relationships between WIP and the other goal variables. Here
                  it is shown that this insight leads to flow time oriented lot sizing models. This
                  type of lot sizing models is analysed. It is argued that the derivation of simple
                  rules for lot sizing is an important research topic, and a model for deriving such
                  rules is presented. Some rules are derived from the model, assuming that the
                  batches are processed by an M/G/I server, and it is shown that these rules support
                  insights based on simulation in the 1980s. Topics for future research are outlined

  Abstract =     {Order release is the interface between the control of the material flow through
                  the entire logistic chain and the control of the production units. Order release
                  mechanisms based on the workload control concept usually are based on functional
                  relationships of time averages of work-in-process, output, flow time, etc. This
                  causes severe limitations especially in the case of time-varying demand. The paper
                  shows that order release can be designed as a hierarchical system with aggregate
                  order release planning as the upper level; aggregate order release planning
                  determines the amount of released work in the planning periods and thus decides on
                  the time-dependent state of the production units and on the balance between
                  inventory variation and production level variation. A decision model for the
                  optimization of aggregate order release is presented that takes into account the
                  dependence of the work centre output on the work-in-process and therefore can be
                  considered as a workload control method. Simulation results show the performance
                  of the model. It is concluded that the optimization model leads to improvements
                  over order release models currently available, Further improvements of the model,
                  based on better integration of research on the transient behaviour of queuing
                  networks, are a topic of future research.},

  Abstract =     {The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, it aims at providing a link between
                  order release mechanisms based on the workload control concept on the one hand and
                  models for aggregate order release planning that optimize the aggregate material
                  flow through a production unit on the other hand. We argue that both approaches
                  aim at optimizing the material flow through a production unit, following a
                  rule-based approach or an optimization-based approach, respectively. Secondly, it
                  highlights the limitations of the models of the latter category that are available
                  today and presents a direction for improvement. We argue that aggregate order
                  release planning models should be based on models of the transient behaviour of
                  queueing networks, and we present one way to accomplish this. (C) 2009 Elsevier

  Abstract =     {Instabilities in production planning and control have received considerable
                  attention due to their negative impact on planning performance. However, extant
                  research has been limited to theoretical (e.g. simulation) settings and has
                  focused on specific methodologies (e.g. mathematical) to overcome instabilities.
                  The objective of this chapter is to make two contributions to the theory
                  development on production planning instabilities. First, it aims to make an
                  empirical contribution through an in-depth case study, and second, it introduces a
                  holistic framework that supports analysis of hierarchical planning systems and
                  their potential instabilities. The in-depth case study is carried out on an
                  industrial company that has difficulty to meet its customer deadlines and faces a
                  significant order backlog. Planners of the company at different hierarchical
                  levels and order chasers on the shop floor end up rescheduling open orders and
                  updating lead times continuously when trying to meet deadlines, but eventually are
                  not able to improve order fulfillment. Only after the introduction of an Advanced
                  Planning System and centralization of planning decisions in a single department,
                  on-time delivery was significantly improved and order back log drastically
                  reduced. This case study allows studying of the underlying mechanism of such
                  planning instabilities, with a particular focus on the impact on stability of
                  human and organizational factors. On the basis of our findings and additional
                  conceptual research we have then developed a framework constituted by six key
                  planning systems attributes. By taking into consideration these factors, a firm
                  can address the root causes of planning instabilities, rather than merely focus on
                  its symptoms.},

  Abstract =     {This paper demonstrates the applicability of a new world class manufacturing (WCM)
                  model developed for the make-to-order (MTO) sector. The model aims to fill a gap
                  in the WCM literature that concentrates on the characteristics of the larger
                  traditional make-to-stock (MTS) sector. It was initially devised using evidence
                  from the literature, especially the MTO literature and the more comprehensive WCM
                  models. It was then modified in the light of case study evidence collected from
                  small and medium sized MTO companies. The model presented in this paper, known as
                  "MTO Principles", is the current version of the model after all the modifications
                  have been incorporated. Its intended purpose is to aid MTO companies to determine
                  their strengths and potential areas for improvement so that they can continue to
                  be competitive in the future. The case study evidence also illustrates the

  Abstract =     {This paper presents a new model developed for make-to-order (MTO) companies to aid
                  in determining appropriate content for performance improvement programmes. The
                  model has been developed using literature evidence and case-study data from six
                  MTO small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As wed as being important aspects
                  of the new model, some of the conclusions from the case-study evidence are
                  important insights into best practice in MTO companies in their own tight, In
                  particular, the evidence suggests that the highly-specialised MTO environment
                  means that multi-skilling is Less important than it is in Less skilled industries.
                  It is also suggested that the need for simple, movable equipment is Less important
                  because these companies often need specialised machinery and maintain a
                  flexibility of process through a traditional functional layout.},

  Abstract =     {This paper investigates the capacity investment decision of a supplier who
                  solicits private forecast information from a manufacturer. To ensure abundant
                  supply, the manufacturer has an incentive to inflate her forecast in a costless,
                  nonbinding, and nonverifiable type of communication known as
                  {\textquotedblleft}cheap talk.{\textquotedblright} According to standard game
                  theory, parties do not cooperate and the only equilibrium is uninformative---the
                  manufacturer's report is independent of her forecast and the supplier does not use
                  the report to determine capacity. However, we observe in controlled laboratory
                  experiments that parties cooperate even in the absence of reputation-building
                  mechanisms and complex contracts. We argue that the underlying reason for
                  cooperation is trust and trustworthiness. The extant literature on forecast
                  sharing and supply chain coordination implicitly assumes that supply chain members
                  either absolutely trust each other and cooperate when sharing forecast
                  information, or do not trust each other at all. Contrary to this all-or-nothing
                  view, we determine that a continuum exists between these two extremes. In
                  addition, we determine (i) when trust is important in forecast information
                  sharing, (ii) how trust is affected by changes in the supply chain environment,
                  and (iii) how trust affects related operational decisions. To explain and better
                  understand the observed behavioral regularities, we also develop an analytical
                  model of trust to incorporate both pecuniary and nonpecuniary incentives in the
                  game-theoretic analysis of cheap-talk forecast communication. The model identifies
                  and quantifies how trust and trustworthiness induce effective cheap-talk forecast
                  sharing under the wholesale price contract. We also determine the impact of
                  repeated interactions and information feedback on trust and cooperation in
                  forecast sharing. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our results
                  for developing effective forecast management policies.This paper was accepted by

                  production. The release methods of the traditional workload control concepts
                  differ in how they deal with the flow of work to each station. Previous research
                  has pointed at strengths and weaknesses of each method. Till now the choice of the
                  appropriate method for a particular situation has hardly received attention. This
                  research shows that shop characteristics are an important factor to this choice. A
                  simulation study indicates that the relative performance of the release methods
                  changes completely with for instance the presence or absence of a dominant flow
                  direction in the shop. Adjustments to the traditional release methods are

  Abstract =     {Due date setting is a difficult task for make-to-order companies and requires
                  efficient capacity and lead time management. In the job-shop literature,
                  production planning for make-to-order companies is tackled by using shop floor
                  scheduling algorithms coupled with simulation. However, capacity management cannot
                  be realized in the most detailed phase of planning and should be carried out at a
                  higher decision level so that work loads are smoothed over time. A linear capacity
                  planning model is proposed for dealing with problems of load leveling in
                  bottleneck departments over a planning horizon. In this model, end items in each
                  order are conveniently grouped into product families so that the proposed model
                  becomes tractable in terms of practical problem sizes. Capacity constraints are
                  included in the model and covers a number of future periods with known firm
                  orders. The objective is to minimize total backorder and overtime costs. In this
                  context, an order is assumed to be backordered if it is delivered some weeks later
                  than that of its arrival. Actually, the time during which an order is backordered
                  represents the production lead time for that order. Furthermore, the production
                  lead time of each order is constrained by an order specific maximum lead time
                  determined as a company policy. The output of the model conveys weekly order
                  release and delivery times which serve as order due dates. Hence, lead time
                  management and due date setting as well as load leveling are achieved by the
                  proposed model. Since the model does not take family set-up times into
                  consideration, an iterative algorithm which balances over time, the additional
                  capacity demanded by set-up times, is proposed. The production plan developed for
                  the bottleneck department is propagated to the other stages of the production
                  system through a binary LP model whose binary variables are reduced at every
                  stage. The proposed multi-stage planning system is applied for planning production
                  in a manufacturing company which makes/assembles custom kitchen cupboards. The
                  case study demonstrates the advantages of the system.},

                  recognize the (nonlinear) relationship between the planned utilization of capacity
                  and lead times. In this paper we provide an in-depth discussion of the
                  state-of-the art in this area, with particular attention to those models that are
                  appropriate at the aggregate planning level.},

  Abstract =     {Several recent studies in experimental economics have tried to measure beliefs of
                  subjects engaged in strategic games with other subjects. Using data from one such
                  study we conduct an experiment where our experienced subjects observe early rounds
                  of strategy choices from that study and are given monetary incentives to report
                  forecasts of choices in later rounds. We elicit beliefs using three different
                  scoring rules: linear, logarithmic, and quadratic. We compare forecasts across the
                  scoring rules and compare the forecasts of our trained observers to forecasts of
                  the actual players in the original experiment. We find significant differences
                  across scoring rules. The improper linear scoring rule produces forecasts closer
                  to 0 and I than the proper rules, and these forecasts are poorly calibrated. The
                  two proper scoring rules induce significantly different distributions of
                  forecasts. We find that forecasts by observers under both proper scoring rules are
                  significantly different from the forecasts of the actual players. in terms of
                  accuracy, calibration, and the distribution of forecasts. We also find evidence
                  for belief convergence among the observers. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  Abstract =     {We investigate a shop where the workers and supervisors have tacit knowledge of
                  how to operate efficiently and where efficiency is important to providing capacity
                  to meet demand. This tacit knowledge includes setup dependencies between products
                  as well as which worker or machine is best suited for a particular product. We
                  discuss a real-world shop where this is the case. Management expects workers and
                  supervisors to use their knowledge to schedule efficiently by monitoring their
                  performance based on standards. The question that we explore is how management
                  should control for due date performance in light of the discretion given to the
                  workers and supervisors to sequence jobs on the basis of efficiency. We explore
                  management control of due date performance through the use of order review and
                  release (ORR) and management expediting. We find that although ORR is quite
                  effective at reducing work-in-process (WIP) inventories, it may foster very late
                  deliveries in a shop such as this. In fact, under such conditions, deftly executed
                  expediting with no ORR at all can be far more effective at supporting all
                  deliveries. Even improving ORR into a hybrid by actively updating path
                  efficiencies (observed from supervisor/worker scheduling) did not support a change
                  to this conclusion. Conversely, when conditions are created where tacit knowledge
                  plays a reduced role or utilization is decreased, ORR delivers in a timely manner.
                  The interaction between utilization, WIP levels, and worker knowledge all help
                  dictate the appropriate control methodology.},

  Abstract =     {Two studies were conducted to test a two-stage model of the psychological
                  mechanisms underlying the overconsumption of scarce resources in small groups. The
                  model proposes that members of groups sharing resources first anchor their
                  consumption choices on an {\textquotedblleft}equal-division{\textquotedblright}
                  heuristic and then, given sufficient cognitive capacity, adjust their choices in a
                  self-serving direction. The results from both studies support the model. The first
                  study found that when faced with a common resource pool almost all group members
                  expressed thoughts regarding equality; however, individuals with sufficient
                  cognitive capacity requested more from the pool and expressed more task-relevant
                  thoughts than individuals lacking the necessary cognitive resources. The second
                  study provided additional support for the two-stage model by demonstrating that
                  group members' cognitions occur in the order predicted by the model and by
                  demonstrating that an individual difference, social value orientation, affects
                  thought processes only when individuals are not experiencing high cognitive loads.
                  Implications are discussed.},

                  caused by supply disruptions. In the RBWE, order variability increases as one
                  moves downstream in the supply chain, and therefore the RBWE is the opposite of
                  the classical bullwhip effect (BWE). We test our conjecture that disruptions cause
                  the RBWE using both a live ``beer game'' experiment and a simulation study. In the
                  beer game, we find that players modify their ordering behavior during disruptions,
                  and that these modifications cause the RBWE. We confirm this cause of the RBWE
                  under a broad range of settings using discrete-event simulation. Our results
                  demonstrate that supply uncertainty (in the form of random disruptions) and an
                  overweighting of the supply line cause the RBWE. They also confirm previous
                  studies showing that demand uncertainty and an underweighting of the supply line
                  cause the BWE. Moreover, our study provides guidance for models of operational
                  disruptions by incorporating human reactions to disruptions.",

  Abstract =     {This paper concerns the modeling of low inventory lines. Currently, most models
                  assume that processing times are independent. We consider the differences in
                  behavior of workers in low- and high-inventory production lines. Using a
                  laboratory experiment we show that workers speed up when they are the cause of
                  idle time on the line. This means that processing time distributions are not
                  independent of the size of the buffer, of the processing speed of co-workers, or
                  of the amount of inventory in the system. We show that the direction of these
                  effects is predictable and that the magnitude is significant. In particular, there
                  is less idle time and higher output than would be predicted using assumptions of
                  independence. In this experiment the effect completely canceled productivity loss
                  due to blocking and starving. This work is important in understanding both the
                  motivation of workers in low-inventory systems and the implications of models of
                  manufacturing flow lines.},

  Abstract =     {Low inventory, a crucial part of just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing systems, enjoys
                  increasing application worldwide, yet the behavioral effects of such systems
                  remain largely unexplored. Operations research (OR) models of low-inventory
                  systems typically use a simplifying assumption that processing times of individual
                  workers are independent random variables. This leads to predictions that
                  low-inventory systems will exhibit production interruptions leading to lower
                  productivity. Yet empirical results suggest that low-inventory systems do not
                  exhibit the predicted productivity losses. This paper develops a model integrating
                  feedback, goal setting, group cohesiveness, task norms, and peer pressure to
                  predict how individual behavior may adjust to alleviate production interruptions
                  in low-inventory systems. In doing so we integrate previous research on the
                  development of task norms. Operations research models are used to show how norms
                  can significantly improve throughput by decreasing variance and increasing the
                  speed of the slowest workers, even if accompanied by decreases in speed of the
                  fastest workers. Findings suggest that low-inventory systems induce individual and
                  group responses that cause behavioral changes that mitigate production
                  interruptions.},

  Abstract =     {Despite the increasing popularity of decision support systems (DSS), effectiveness
                  of such systems remains unproven. Past research claiming usefulness of the DSS has
                  relied largely on anecdotal or case data. The relatively few laboratory
                  experiments report mixed results regarding the effects of a decision aid. This
                  study reviews the results of prior investigations and examines the effectiveness
                  of DSS-aided decision makers relative to decision makers without a DSS over an
                  eight-week period. An executive decision making game was used in two sections of a
                  business strategy course. Three-person teams in one section used a DSS while the
                  teams in the other section played the game without such an aid.Various measures of
                  decision quality were recorded. Overall, the groups with access to the DSS made

  Abstract =     {This paper addresses the problem of scheduling a two-stage manufacturing system.
                  MRP systems have been developed to synchronize production in multistage systems,
                  assigning due dates to production at each stage. However, MRP systems allow just a
                  broad scheduling and it is therefore up to the short term scheduling system to
                  meet such due dates. Previous research work, and industrial practice, have
                  developed independent scheduling systems for each stage, relying on MRP to
                  synchronize them. Resulting performances are not satisfactory because, quite
                  often, many components are late, and assembly schedules are disrupted. Recent
                  research works on assembly shops have shown that improvements in performances can
                  be achieved if assembly constraints and dependencies between jobs are also
                  considered at the short term scheduling level. Based on the idea that these
                  findings can be valid for multi-stage manufacturing systems, this research work
                  presents a new short term scheduling procedure which, on the one hand adopts two
                  different scheduling systems for the machining stage and the assembly stage, and
                  on the other, highly integrates short term scheduling of different stages. The
                  former exploits the different characteristics of the two subsystems. In
                  particular, unlike all previous research work, assembly constraints and
                  dependencies between jobs are taken into consideration at the machining stage,
                  both at the dispatching level, and at the Order Review and Release level.},

  Abstract =     {Drum-Buffer-Rope (DBR) is an alternative approach to manufacturing planning and
                  control that is not as formally tested as Material Requirements Planning (MRP)
                  systems which have traditionally been around for years. Yet, some reports indicate
                  very good performance for DBR and the associated use of synchronous manufacturing
                  principles. But how do these systems compare and relate to one another- Based on
                  our experiences of studying a Bearing Manufacturing Company that actually made the
                  transition from an MRP system to a DBR system, we conduct simulation-based
                  experiments in this paper with the objective of providing a more formal comparison
                  between these two systems than what has been offered in prior literature. To our
                  knowledge, this is the only study of its kind that uses a real-world setting to
                  evaluate key differences and convergence points between comprehensive MRP and DBR
                  systems. Our results show that even though the MRP and DBR systems position
                  inventory differently and provide different dynamic responses to customer demand,
                  there are several operating policies that can be implemented in either system.
                  While the DBR performance in our simulation model was clearly superior to a
                  nominal MRP implementation, we show that even within the constraints of the
                  structural design of MRP system, policy modification based on DBR principles can
                  significantly reduce these performance differences. This finding has an important
                  implication for practising managers who need not necessarily switch from a MRP
                  system to a DBR type of a system (as was done by our case-study. firm) in order to
                  take advantage of attractive features of the DBR system. Future researchers can
                  use our study to understand more fully how these Structural Design and Operating
                  Policy differences can be further exploited to implement unique systems that
                  combine the best features of both DBR and MRP systems.},

                  various sectors of the Make-To-Order (MTO) Industry is presented. The paper
                  considers factors such as the importance of the customer enquiry stage, company
                  size, degree of customization and shop floor configuration and shows them to play

  Abstract =     {Most literature on job shops assumes that an infinite storage space is available
                  on the shop floor. But in practice, storage space is limited or finite. The job
                  shop control problem with finite storage space has received little attention; it
                  is a complex problem for which optimised scheduling may lead to unfeasible and
                  poor quality solutions. The alternative to a scheduling solution is the use of
                  controlled order release. This study uses simulation to assess the performance of
                  four order release control rules. Results indicate that the best results are
                  achieved by the workload control order release (WLCOR) rule. This rule produces
                  results comparable to the optimum solution identified by analytical modelling in
                  terms of the storage space required to achieve a certain production rate. The
                  advantage of WLCOR is that it does this while simultaneously controlling lead
                  times and the percentage of tardy jobs. Results have significant implications for
                  practice, particularly where space is at a premium.},

                  experimental design with three due-date assignment rules, three scheduling rules
                  and three order release models. The three order release models are: (1) Basic
                  model, in which three due-date assignment rules consider the order arrival time as
                  the order release time; (2) Control model, in which three due-date assignment
                  rules integrate with the order release control method developed here; and (3)

  Abstract =     {The concept of representativeness and the conditions in which it can be used to
                  explain intuitive predictions and probability judgments are discussed. Four cases
                  of representativeness are distinguished that refer to the relations between a
                  value and a variable; an instance and a category; a sample and a population; an
                  effect and a cause. The principles of representativeness differ significantly from
                  the laws of probability. In particular, specificity can increase the
                  representativeness of an event, even though it always reduces its probability.
                  Several studies of judgment are reported in which naive and sophisticated
                  respondents judge a conjunction to be more probable than one of its components.

  Abstract =     {Screen/report design for output organization is still very much a common
                  sense-driven activity. This paper identifies a preliminary set of factors beyond
                  display format for examination as screen/report design variables. A laboratory
                  experiment was conducted to assess the influence of one of these factors, spatial
                  layout of information, along with display format in an information recall context.
                  Individual imagery orientation (verbalizer/visualizer) was used as a moderating
                  variable in the experimental design. The findings indicate that spatial layout of
                  information significantly influenced performance when the recall task involved
                  pattern detection. In fact, a central location of data in a document was the most
                  conducive to pattern recall performance. Further, terminal items facilitated
                  pattern recall better than early input items. With respect to display format, the
                  results support previous findings that a tabular display enhances performance for
                  point-value recall tasks while graphs exhibit an edge over tables for pattern
                  types of recall tasks. Overall, the verbalizers demonstrated a complete supremacy
                  in performance. Interaction between individual imagery orientation and display
                  format indicates that, while the verbalizers and the mixed type were immune to
                  display format variations, the graphical stimulus enhanced the pattern recall
                  performance of the visualizers.},

  Volume =       16,
  Abstract =     {This study examines the definition of theory and the implications it has for the
                  theory-building research. By definition, theory must have four basic criteria:
                  conceptual definitions, domain limitations, relationship-building, and
                  predictions. Theory-building is important because it provides a framework for
                  analysis, facilitates the efficient development of the field, and is needed for
                  the applicability to practical real world problems. To be good theory, a theory
                  must follow the virtues (criteria) for `good' theory, including uniqueness,
                  parsimony, conservation, generalizability, fecundity, internal consistency,
                  empirical riskiness, and abstraction, which apply to all research methods.
                  Theory-building research seeks to find similarities across many different domains
                  to increase its abstraction level and its importance. The procedure for good
                  theory-building research follows the definition of theory: it defines the
                  variables, specifies the domain, builds internally consistent relationships, and
                  makes specific predictions. If operations management theory is to become
                  integrative, the procedure for good theory-building research should have similar
                  research procedures, regardless of the research methodology used. The empirical
                  results from a study of operations management over the last 5 years (1991--1995)
                  indicate imbalances in research methodologies for theory-building. The analytical
                  mathematical research methodology is by far the most popular methodology and
                  appears to be over-researched. On the other hand, the integrative research areas
                  of analytical statistical and the establishment of causal relationships are
                  under-researched. This leads to the conclusion that theory-building in operations
                  management is not developing evenly across all methodologies. Last, this study
                  offers specific guidelines for theory-builders to increase the theory's level of
                  abstraction and the theory's significance for operations managers.},

  Abstract =     {Due to the nondeterministic nature of the business environment of a manufacturing
                  enterprise, it is more appropriate to describe the aggregated production planning
                  by using a fuzzy mathematical programming model. In this paper, a genetics-based
                  inexact approach is proposed to imitate the human decision procedure for
                  production planning. Instead of locating one exact optimal solution, the proposed
                  approach finds a family of inexact solutions within an acceptable level by
                  adopting a mutation operator to move along a weighted gradient direction, Then, a
                  decision maker can select a preferred solution by examining a convex combination
                  of the solutions in the family via the human-computer interaction, Our
                  computational experiments illustrate how the enterprise managers can be more
                  satisfied by this new approach than others.},

  Abstract =     {A norm is an established and self-reinforcing pattern of behaviour: everyone wants
                  to play their part given the expectation that everyone else will continue to play
                  theirs. It is, in short, an equilibrium of a game. This paper surveys some of the
                  ways in which norms structure economic life: in the definition (and division) of
                  property, in the terms of contracts, and in the assignment of social roles. We
                  argue that norms can evolve from the cumulative effect of many decentralized
                  interactions by individuals who are trying to solve a coordination problem. The
                  theory suggests circumstances under which evolutionary forces favor norms that are
                  efficient and more or less egalitarian in their distributive implications. (C)
